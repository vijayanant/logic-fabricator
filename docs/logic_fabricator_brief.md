# Logic Fabricator — Brief (v0.1)

> *"Rules are meant to be broken. Or fabricated. Preferably both."*

## 🧠 What Is It?

**Logic Fabricator** is a playground for building, breaking, and bending systems of reasoning. Think: your own private laboratory where you get to define what "makes sense" — and then see what happens when you run a world on it.

It's part theorem prover, part philosophical toy, part simulator of strange belief systems. And yes, it's powered by an LLM and its trusty sidekick: a mildly neurotic memory core that never forgets your contradictions.

In short: it's not just logic. It's *your* logic. Fabricated.

---

## ❓ Why Does It Exist?

Because the world is full of arguments, and no one can see the rulebook.

Because sometimes you'd like to simulate a debate between a Stoic, a Capitalist, and a Cat.

Because logic is too important to be left to math class.

And because, for the first time ever, we have the tech (LLMs, memory, flexible inference engines) to make logic itself a **creative medium**.

## 🔍 What Does It Do?

You tell it things like:

```text
- Trust increases truth.
- Contradictions cause belief to fracture.
- Doubt is not the opposite of certainty, it's the precursor.
```

It turns those into logic structures (rules, graphs, score functions, maybe dark rituals if enabled).

You can:

- Simulate scenarios under your logic system
- See where it breaks or contradicts
- Fork and remix other people's logic sets
- Track mutations over time like a Git for thought
- Ask it "what happens if..." and get answers *inside* your fabricated logic

## 🛠️ How Is It Built?

**Backend-ish stack:**

- LLM (GPT-4 / Claude) for turning your strange statements into structured logic
- Lightweight inference engine (Z3, PyDatalog, custom if we get feisty)
- MCP-style memory layer for storing logic forks, contradictions, and philosophical detours
- Text-based simulator for now; visual/world simulation later
- All wrapped in a clean backend you can poke with code, CLI, or API

It’s basically a compiler for belief.

---

## 🌍 Who Is It For?

People who:

- Build imaginary worlds for fun
- Want to see how belief systems might evolve
- Teach or explore logic, but don't want to bore anyone
- Argue for a living (philosophers, ethicists, game designers, that one guy at the pub)
- Are tired of AI hallucinating and want to build the rules themselves

---

## ✨ What’s in the First Version?

- Input logic rules in natural language
- View internal graph or tree of logic
- Ask questions like "what follows from this?"
- Detect contradictions (statement-level and proactive rule-level)
- Fork, mutate, remix logics
- Simulate a tiny story or scenario under that logic

No accounts. No save buttons. The logic remembers you. (Okay, fine, we'll add persistence.)

---

## 🌱 What Might It Become?

- A simulation engine for belief systems, religions, cultures
- A game mechanic for worldbuilding
- A philosophical toy for classrooms and strange dinner parties
- A social logic-sharing platform ("oh, you’re running a postmodern empathy fork? Nice.")
- A weird little oracle you argue with at 3am

---

## ✏️ Status

- Idea: Fully fabricated
- Core engine: forming in the void
- Memory model: sketching contradictions
- Voice and vibe: nailed
- Next step: start wiring the logic core and see what it dreams up
